# TakaSoft

Sandbox project to retrieve color from Adafruit TCS34725 sensor.
It sends the result from Arduino to Java software using COM Port, and displaying colors with transition between them.

This soft is not made for production usage.
Front as been generated by ChatGPT for basic form.
Form doesn't work, no need to for my use. Feel free to complete it.
